# ESP8266 Sous Vide Controller

## Quick Start

You'll need the following hardware:

1) a relay capable to turn on and off a heater element
2) A 1-Wire DS18B20 temperature sensors

On the software side you will need to modify the config.h file to fit your needs.

Compile, upload and connect to it using a browser, and the UI should be self explanatory (or so I hope)
